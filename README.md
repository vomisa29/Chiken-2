This is the first laboratory's repository. Its objective is to provide an environment for students to practice their skills in the Data Structure and Algorithms (#EDA) course and familiarize them with the MVC pattern in Python, the VS Code IDE, and the GIT/GitHub technologies.

This repository is part of the data structure and algorithms (#EDA) teaching framework at Universidad de los Andes. The repository was developed by faculty professors and staff in the Department of Systems and Computer Engineer (#DISC) and uses the Non-Object-Oriented Python library **DISCLib**.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a template repository to use in the laboratories in the data structures and algorithms (#EDA) course at Uniandes.

**IMPORTANT** This is a work in progress and is part of a teaching framework for undergraduate college students at Universidad de los Andes. This project Is NOT intended as a full-functional source code project.

<!-- STRUCTURE -->
### Structure

This laboratory repository has four main parts:

1. [DISClib](./DISClib) Root folder with the official course library. For more on its implementation visit the [DISClib Repository][disclib-url].
1. [App](./App) Folder with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Python scripts. In here the students implement their code to complete the laboratory instructions.
1. [Data](./Data) Folder with CSV data files to load into the application. In here the students add the data files provided by the course staff to complete the laboratory.
1. [Docs](./Docs) Folder with the report, data table and other documentation. In here the students add their project report, data tables and other files to complement their code implementation.
